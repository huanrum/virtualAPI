In addition, there were several radio controlled units and some static prop versions. A full functioning, self-contained robotic unit was not practical for shooting, so most of the \"walking\" scenes were achieved by the puppet, with rods removed in post production. Later a self standing remote controlled unit was constructed and used at promotional events.[9]<br><br>",

Many years ago, Walt Disney introduced the world to enchanted realms of fantasy and adventure, yesterday and tomorrow, in a magical place called Disneyland. Today that spirit of imagination and discovery comes to life in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Disneyland is dedicated to the young and the young at heart - with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration, and an enduring symbol of the cooperation, friendship and understanding between the people of Hong Kong and the United States of America.\n<br><br>\nMichael D. Eisner and Donald Tsang, 12 September 2005\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://10.0.101.215/dev4/image/tng4.0_couponticket_detail_img_2.jpg\" width=100%>\n<br><br>\nThe park is divided into \"lands\" (themed areas) and well-concealed backstage areas. On entering a land, a guest is completely immersed in a themed environment and is unable to see or hear any other realm. The idea behind this was to develop theatrical \"stages\" with seamless passages from one land to the next. The public areas occupy approximately 27.4 hectares (68 acres). When the park initially opened, it consisted of only four classic themed areas instead of the traditional five lands:\n<br><br>\nMain Street, U.S.A., designed to resemble an early 20th-century Midwest town;\nAdventureland, featuring jungle-themed adventures;\nFantasyland, bringing to life characters and places from Disney's movies for children;\nTomorrowland, an optimistic vision of the future.\n<br><br>\n<img src=\"http://10.0.101.215/dev4/image/tng4.0_couponticket_detail_img_1.jpg\" width=100%>\n<br><br>\nThe park features a daytime parade \"Flights of Fantasy\", as well as a nighttime parade \"Paint the Night\", and a nighttime firework show \"Disney in the Stars\".
